# Grapher
A javascript implementation for Graph theory algorithms

**The Goal:**

This is an old project I did it once when I was a student learning about Graphs Theory.
I build it with *Javascript*, *jquery* and ***LOVE***. 

The goal of the project was to implement most of the graph theory topics we learned during a graph theory course in 2016.
We were required to develop a system with a good-enough UI that allows the user to:
* create a graph (with Nodes and weighted Edges).
* edit the graph.
* save it as a file.
* open a graph XML file. 
 
-- note: 
The UI is not user friendly at all!.
**I know**, at that time the main focus was on the Algorithms.

**See it Live**
You can play around with it live here: [Open the Grapher](https://ayhamjaradat.github.io/Grapher/)

## System UI Features: 

1. Create a graph by drag-drop.
1. Name and edit graph nodes.
1. Set and edit Edge weights.
1. Delete nodes and edges.
1. Save a created graph as xml file.
1. Open xml file and render it as a graph. 
1. Create or upload multiple graphs in the same window.
1. Show the content of uploaded files as row xml.

## System Graph Theory Functionality:
1. Check if a graph is Bipartile or not.
1. Check if a graph is Planner or not.
1. Check if a graph is Tree or not.
1. List all paths of 1,2,3,... n length
1. List all cycles (loops) of 3,4,,,,n length
1. List all Euler paths or cycles in a graph
1. List all Hamilton paths and cycles
1. Color the graph (Graph coloring problem)
1. Check Izomorphism between two graphs.
1. Find the Short Path between two nodes.
